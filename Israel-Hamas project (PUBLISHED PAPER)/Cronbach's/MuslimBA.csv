What is it that seems to have everyone so anti-Israel right now? I know there's always war in the middle east, but tensions have risen a ton as of late. Hamas attacked Israel in October, and I know that Israel is fighting back, often in less than ethical ways. But aren't Hamas and Palestine also committing crimes and being violent against Israelis? Why has the general attitude turned so anti-Israel in what's going on?

It's crazy to me that israel went to be known as this tourist hub known for beaches and clubs and this reputation for human rights and democracy. A destination for many and example for all especially to the middle-east to basically a laughing stock and being revealed as a morally bankrupt state.

First let's start with the IDF losing any source of credibility. Many people love making fun of hamas ministry of health numbers saying how little trust they have in them. Well guess what to the majority of people the IDF numbers and reputation matches Hamas.

Just looks at all these IDF examples.

I mean the examples goes on and on. It's a shame this sub-redditt doesn't allow videos because the videos I can post about the IDF army and their behavior are countless for any one video you could post , i can provide five its insane. At one point the IDF had this reputation of being a supreme military force that was an envy to other world military forces. Guess what that's down the drain. The IDF record at fighting in the ground against hamas has been terrible, they basically only have an advantage when it comes to dropping bombs from an airplane to a force that has no air power. Their fighting a military force that is using Soviet era machine guns while they have 21st century armory and have a poor record. Can't tell you how many military podcasts make fun of the ineptitude of the IDF on the ground.

https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/10/26/israel-hamas-gaza-military-idf-technology-surveillance-fence-strategy-ground-war/

And what a hungry for blood mentality by israel , I don't see many people on this sub-reddit talk about the embassy bombing in syria. But its hard to even find a modern example of another country attacking an embassy. Under the 1961 Vienna convention on diplomatic immunity, the premises of a diplomatic mission are inviolable. I mean you can just feel the Telegram of israel wanting iran to retaliate to justify a Lebanese invasion or spreading the war to Iran. If I was a citizen I would be outraged my country is trying to expand the war. But guess what netanyahu is trying his hardest to stay in power and you smucks are happy letting him play a political game while we're seeing one of the worst modern massacres of our life time. Yes let's tie a war with a politician that's trying to remain in power so he won't go to jail for corruption, I don't see anything wrong with that

Every single international body, almost every citizen in all countries have been shocked and distrusted by the actions of the IDF and the israel government. The amount of tourists that will go to israel will decrease the amount of citizens leaving the country is also increasing. Honestly seeing a country going from 100 to 0 is quite amazing but somehow israel is doing it. You have support of the U.S government, the president of the united states calls himself a proud zionest and many still pretend that nobody supports israel and you are all being malignant attacked for your religion when infact your actions is what anybody needs to judge you fairly.

Many comments are going to reply what do you expect a country to do post oct 7, well it's definitely not what been happening for these past 5 month, hopefully countries have a playbook on what not to do by not following this inept country and it's military.","Please read the following social media post:

I was looking at the number of Palestinians terrorists released for each hostage both in the past and in the current situation and the ratio is insane.

As someone who fully supports Israel why does this happen ?

Is there really so much leverage on their side that for each hostage so many terrorists need to be released ?

If anything, multiple hostages should be released for each terrorist !","Please read the following social media post:

I said what I said. I can’t fathom why people could so strongly support either the state of Israel or a Hamas-led Palestinian state. Both have been committing unspeakable acts against each other. Going back in history, sure, Israel’s offensive has led to more Palestinian deaths than vice versa. That is the outcome of having U.N. aide and support. Is it wrong to say that if you choose Israel or Palestine, you are just blindly supporting your own racist ideologies? I feel as if people are choosing white vs. brown when it is so much more complex than that. Should I, as a Christian, be under the belief that we should take Jerusalem back for ourselves? No. But we have just as much claim over that Holy land that Jews or Muslims would? So why are we acting like Palestine is in the right, or that Israel is in the right? Being pro-Israel does not call for a ceasefire. It calls for brutal retaliation that no good human or practicing Christian or Jew should support this or the things they have doen in the past to oppress Palestinians. Being pro-Palestine does not call for a ceasefire, it further creates tension and the divide only grows stronger. No Christian or Muslim should support the things they have done. You are not advocating for peace if you are only advocating for donating and helping one side. Just my two cents, as a local white boy! Not sure if my race matters, but race seems to be all that matters to a lot of pro-Israel or pro-Palestine supporters! I am not spewing pro-Zionist bullshit here. Calling for peace is not pro-Israel. And it’s not pro-Palestine. It’s being a good human with proper morals. The divide is so strong already in the Middle East, it shouldn’t extend to the States and the UK, we should all be denouncing both.","Please read the following social media post:

* Maintaining the status quo (Self-evident)

Why it might work- Neither side can agree on a solution, and forcing a solution will lead to conflict.

Why it might not- Things are getting worse, not better. Tensions and attacks on both sides will only keep increasing.

* One Israeli state (Israel annexes the West Bank and possibly Gaza)

Why it might work- It will give Palestinians full rights to live and travel in Israel, with the benefits that entails.

Why it might not- It removes Palestinian national self-determination, and it may be too complicated to control militant groups.

* One Palestinian state (Palestinians gain control of all Palestinian territories and Israel)

Why it might work- Palestinians will be able to fulfill goals of the Palestinian National Charter.

Why it might not- It removes Jewish self-determination and will likely endanger the Jewish population of Israel.

* One state for two peoples (A new country is formed that is neither Israeli nor Palestinian)

Why it might work- It's the most progressive on paper, and reaching an agreement for a two-state solution is too complicated due to both sides having strong demands.

Why it might not- Neither side want this, and it is primarily supported by foreigners who will assume that everything will work out despite the bad blood and tension between the two groups.

* Two-state solution (The division of land between the two groups, forming two states)

Why it might work- It gives both Israelis and Palestinians firm sovereign borders.

Why it might not- Neither side can agree to the various demands of the other side. Extremists may not accept the results.

* Three-state solution (Egypt annexes Gaza and Jordan annexes the West Bank)

Why it might work- It would be easier to negotiate with Egypt and Jordan, and they would be able to better control Palestinian militant groups.

Why it might not- Egypt and Jordan don't want to take the responsibility, and Palestinians would almost certainly reject it.

* Confederation (Two states with freedom of travel between each and cooperation on issues of greater importance such as security and water)

Why it might work- It gives both groups sovereignty, and the concessions made during negotiations wouldn't be as impactful and thus less resented.

Why it might not- It requires a great deal of trust between the two groups, and there is too much animosity for it to be effective.

One plan that doesn't seem to get enough attention is:

* The Federation Plan

Under the Federation Plan, Israel and the West Bank will be divided into small states. The government will lose much of it power, and each state will be controlled by a local government. This will give small-scale political self-determination while still maintaining equal rights on both a local and federal level. It will mitigate the infighting both between and within Israel and the Palestinian territories. On the other hand, it might not be feasible if the borders are drawn unfairly or if one group dominates the federal government.

What are your thoughts?","Please read the following social media post:

Hi, I'm Israeli and, 6 months after Oct. 7, I wanted to share my opinions on all this mess. I am far-left, and what I am about to say at the end will probably seem extremist and insane, but I really ask you to read the whole thing so that you understand the whole picture I'm trying to pain here. First of all, about the situation in Gaza: I have always been far-left, and I always advocated for Palestinian rights, then end of the occupation and colonization of the West Bank, etc. After Oct 7, the shock and trauma really impacted me and my opinions: I saw people advocating for the obliteration of my country, and I found myself for the first time in a long time, defending Israel and its actions. I said things like: ""Yes, what is happening to the Gazans is horrible, but the IDF does everything it can to hurt as little civilians as possible, [and it is true.](https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/the-hamas-terrorist-organization/how-is-the-idf-minimizing-harm-to-civilians-in-gaza/) At least it was at the start of the war. I had an argument saying that Israel only targets civilian infrastructure where Hamas terrorists are located. But when I see that [entire cities are flattened](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-68006607), I can only conclude that this is not the case anymore. It was the case at the start of the war and in previous wars, but it is not now. However, I still do not thing this is a genocide. It is a carnage and a bloodshed, and some Israelis and Israeli politicians do want to exterminate Gazans, but it is not the goal of this war and it is certainly no the reason most Israelis supported the war in the past; they supported it because they wanted a response to the Oct 7 massacres and wanted to bring the hostages back. I say supported because, [a lot of Israelis are against this war](https://www.npr.org/2024/01/20/1225168320/israel-antiwar-movement-mothers-soldiers-gaza-war), for the return of the hostages, and the end of the bloodshed. And I'm part of them.

Now about issues on Israel itself: I don't know if all of you know this, but a few months after Bibi's (Netanyahu) ultranationalist far-right government came to power in December 2022, they wanted to pass a basic law (Israel has no constitution but it has something called [Basic Laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Laws_of_Israel) that state how the country should be run), that pretty much made the supreme court obsolete ([details](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israeli_judicial_reform)), meaning the government could do anything they wanted without any restrictions. Sounds like a dictatorship right? That's because it is, and the Israeli people understood that too, and [mass protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israeli_judicial_reform_protests) erupted all over the country. They were however interrupted by the Oct 7 attacks.

It will not come as a surprise to a lot of Israelis, including myself, that Bibi is continuing the war to remain in power. He failed miserably to protect the country on Oct 7 and still miserably fails to bring back the hostages. He does not want to make a ceasefire and a deal because he wants to show how strong he is against Hamas. But he fails miserably even in that. Hamas terrorists managed to [return to the Al-Shifa hospital](https://www.jpost.com/israel-hamas-war/article-793708), and Hamas does not seem to lose control of Gaza. In short, Bibi is a criminal, a dictator, a horrible man for what he does to Gaza and to Israel itself, and on top of that, he fails to achieve what Israel needs while causing pain and suffering to millions of people.

So why do I say my opinions may seem extreme? Because of what I'm going to say next. Bibi said that [elections in a time of war is a bad idea](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/netanyahu-dismisses-election-calls-thousands-protest-tel-aviv-2024-02-17/): ""The last thing we need right now are elections and dealing with elections, since it will immediately divide us"". So imagine the war lasts until the next elections, does this mean they will be delayed? I really believe this country is slowly turning into a full scale dictatorship. First reforms that allow the government to do whatever it wants, now a risk that elections might be delayed, what next? If the country is a dictatorship, then I believe that the only solution might be a revolution. Now hear me out, I believe that violence is always the last option. But when you see [mass protests](https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/netanyahu-sacks-defence-minister-sparking-mass-protests/) that last for months resulting in nothing, I think we are heading to a moment where a revolution is needed. It doesn't have to be a violent one. It can be civil disobedience, mass strikes in important areas. Imagine three weeks of the whole country without electricity, fuel or water, and where hundreds of thousands of citizens at a time don't pay their taxes. The government would be forced to comply. I agree this is everything but realistic, but this is my opinion and what I think should be best. And again, we only need to do this when the situation will be extreme (when the elections are officially delayed for example) to prevent any unnecessary violent events; and also because it is true that not having fuel and electricity during a war is not the best thing. But I do believe it will be necessary if the country stays in this direction.

Most of you will probably not agree with me, and a lot of Israelis do not, but a lot of them, including myself, feel that the country's survival is at stake (as much because of Hamas than because of Bibi). Imagine your country turning into a dictatorship, I'm sure it will spark some anger in you.

All that to say that in order to end the Palestinians' suffering, to stop Israel into turning into a dictatorship, and to finally bring peace between Israelis and Palestinians, a revolution will be needed if we stay in the same path. We can always look for a better solution, but we are heading that way.

So tell me what do you think. Can you suggest another solution? Or if you really do not agree with me, explain why.

Virtual schooling has no impact on the conflict. As for funding by Patriot’s owner, that’s a whole separate issue. I have very strong feelings against the hold that people with money have over literally every institution.

Let's start with the authors views on the IDF.  Not totally wrong - the IDF has a large/technologically advanced military.  They fly some of the newest/latest/greatest planes (US made F35's, etc).  With that said, the force is also comprised of conscripts (use whatever term you want) and simply put the IDF is not all professional soldiers.  In the middle of combat do they make mistakes?  Yes.  Have they killed both innocent children and members of the media?  Yes.  Is this wrong?  YES!  However this is part of the overall collateral damage of war.  War is HELL.  People on both sides get hurt and die.  The 'good side' doesn't always win.  

Is Israel morally bankrupt?  I guess the answer depends on the view point.  Using two extreme examples:
1. If you lived in Gaza and were forced from your home, and are now on the brink of starvation?  Yes
2. If you lived 30 miles to the east, and watched as your elderly uncles were shot and killed, and then had your very own grandmother taken from her home and held as a hostage - I would imagine your viewpoint would be different.
