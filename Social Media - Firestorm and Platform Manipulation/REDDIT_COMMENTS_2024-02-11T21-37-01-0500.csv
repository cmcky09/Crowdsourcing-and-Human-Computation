You can call literally anything in this game a ""pointless grind,"" but for an MMO with progression systems the grind IS the point, and there are no shortage of other game genres to avail yourself of with no progression systems. 

It already takes one evening a week to max out conquest before they remove the cap, and a couple evenings to get full honour gear.

Once you get fully geared and reached your rating goal you're done with that character. Also conquest is gated early in the season so it's actually very fair for new players to jump in and reach the same cap that players who started at the beginning are at. Say its week 5 and a player that started week 1 got 500 conquest each week. So now they'd have 2500 by week 5. The new player starts on week 5 and has the ability to get 2500 conquest right away and be caught up with the other player.

If it was *really* about skill, then they should make gear cosmetic and give every rogue the same stats in a battleground as every other rogue, and the same for all the classes. (basically the GW2 method, which goes the extra mile of having a unique pvp only set of talents and abilities that allows for separate balancing of pvp and pve)

They tried it in legion and pvpers whined and moaned. That was some of the best time I ever had in pvp. I felt like I could actually contribute without being instagibbed, or spending weeks getting better gear so I wouldn't get instagibbed, which have never been very fun weeks of gameplay so I quit pvp until the next expansion because I'm not having fun.

M+ season - Season 3 is by far the best, it’s the most accessible season to get into. Doing your weekly 20’s feels eas. There’s still some affixes that may be out of date like bursting/bolstering but the dungeons this season made them bearable imo.

Proffessions - I maxed leather working more for completionist reasons so for me it was alright. It’s definitely missing something to make me more interested in it which may be the work order system, it would be neat to have a steady source of gold coming from work orders. 

Public events - super bloom, (current day) community feast, grand hunt, time rifts, researchers, azerothian archives are S tier for me. Zskera was really fun the first couple times but later on began to feel like a chore mentally.

Catalyst system is near perfect, especially with the way of obtaining previous tiers gear for free.

The upgrade system is great, a sort of catch-up or increase to the amount you get the higher you go would be nice since the later on into the season you play, especially on alts, it becomes to feel like a drag.

wow,1aok4si,kq08zir,t3_1aok4si,exzeeo,/r/wow/comments/1aok4si/whats_the_recommended_item_level_for_mythic_level/kq08zir/,"Depends on if you are pugging into a key, hosting the key, or doing it with friends/guildies. 

For pugging into a 15 key you probably want to be 450+ on a tank or healer with some io on that too. You would likely want to be 460+ as a dps. The ilvl is important because pugs are usually pretty disorganized and people dont play their classes on the higher end of the skill gap. Having the extra gear usually lets your gear carry your performance. Pugs often choose people based on io, ilvl, and meta class.

If you are hosting the key, 450 all around should be fine. As long as you arent a hard carry most people are willing to do the key and are happy to be invited. It is always upsetting when you try to push io on a toon and you see a toon in the group with half your hp and you personally dont have great gear. Its fine to be the least geared in the group but dont expect randoms to carry you.

If you are with guildies or friends then any ilvl should be fine realistically. Id say around 440 will keep you from insta dying to anything and gives you plenty of wiggle room to get loot and still do a decent bit of damage. 9 times out of 10, what makes or breaks a key is interrupts and cc. 

**If its bis gear from the previous season you can 100% push higher in it. I think people were pushing well over 20s in ptr in 440 gear until they buffed the dungeons. (Granted these were super skilled players with group organization and discord coordination)

The big thing is just pugs dont use a lot of braincells to pick people so they often just invite the most geared or most meta people that sign up. Its easier to host if you play as a dps and it gives you more control of the group. 

Tell us a bit more about what class/spec you play, your key experience so far, and what your goal(s) are and we can help you a bit more than some vague advice on be a certain ilvl.",2024-02-11 23:39:22,2,,2024-02-11 18:23:48.657536

A brief backstory, my main is a healer, I’ve just hit 470ilvl and I’ve been running +20’s no problem. My first PUG 15 on my resto Druid I was 430 ilvl, a Rise, and it sucked but we timed it and I have never struggled to get into higher keys as a healer. So, if you want to run +15 and higher, roll a tank and a healer and you’ll never be waiting to get into groups. 

I’ve hit 2500 rating on my healer so I decided to play my BM hunter that I’ve had since Legion. I have 468 ilvl and I’m already at 2200 rating. I CANNOT get into anything over a 16, and even then I’m lucky if I can get into a 16. I literally get instant declined. I’m even getting declined for +15’s. I finally got a drop (helmet, mine was 454), upgraded it and finally hit 470 ilvl. All of a sudden, I’m able to queue into +15’s with no issue whatsoever. Sometimes I will be applying to groups for over 30 minutes getting declined until someone “took a chance on me”. 95% of the time I was highest damage overall by at least 30k, and either the lowest or second lowest damage, and that was the most frustrating thing. The amount of people who had 470+ ilvl that I was out damaging when I had 460 ilvl was absurd. I know BM is in a great spot right now but that’s a bit ridiculous. I just had a windwalker monk blow me out of the water last night and that’s one of the most complained about classes outside of frost DK, so there’s just no excuses. 

Long story short, people have unrealistic views of the game when it comes to DPS. And, for those who will say “but yea, there are just people with higher io and ilvl than you applying” it just shows how bad peoples mentality is that people with 2.5k rating and 470+ ilvl have to play lower keys just to play the game because of crazy gate keeping at keys +15 and over.",2024-02-12 00:08:38,1,,2024-02-11 18:23:48.657536

On the other hand you got retail that is rather smooth and not-grindy ride but is probably a bit more overwhelming to new player who goes in blind because even regular NPCs you need to kill for quests can have more abilities than endgame bosses in vanilla, but will also cost you dragonflight expansion next to subscription to play endgame

What do you want? Retail is far more accessible in terms of QOL features, but less so for the main selling point of the game, endgame. Retail WoW is almost exclusively played at endgame. Classic WoW is played at every level (more or less). Season of Discovery is a great start for Classic right now.

Obliterate is *supposed* to hit like a truck. That's what makes the spec fun, and what's made it fun for years dating back as far as at least MOP.

Nerfing obliterate to make our other shitty abilities do more damage is a fucking awful direction.

Signed, Frost DK of over a decade.

Frost needs three things, in order of importance:

1. A buff to obliterate where, if it would cleave, but it cannot, the isolated target takes some amount of extra damage
2. moving obliterate's cleave to remorseless winter
3. A change to icecap that lets you store charges of cooldown reduction similar to inexorable assault 

Reasoning:

The biggest problem Obliterate faces as a build is it does insane AOE damage, which means you cannot buff Oblit further without making the cleave damage go absolutely nuclear. 

This solution lets you pack some single target damage back into the kit without making the AOE go even harder.

Moving cleave to remorseless winter is just removing the annoying ""root to cleave"" mechanic, while also enabling the ""buffed single target damage"" effect to occur as a natural part of the rotation, also creating even more incentive to RW right before PoF as a bit of skill expression 

Three is because our spec is tied directly to our uptime on the boss. Lost uptime is a death knell on our overall DPS, and makes fights where we cannot tunnel REALLY rough. This would give some wiggle room where if you're off the boss for x amount of time, your next several attacks going back in all proc the reduced CDR, essentially softening the uptime requirement a bit and giving us the freedom to do mechanics easier without tanking our DPS.",2024-02-12 00:42:11,8,,2024-02-11 18:23:50.468591

I also think PoF needs to be on GCD and generate runes/rp and do damage to stop the bullshit macros were using at the moment. There also needs to he some sort of cleaving strikes change or just remove it as it's incredibly toxic to play. Your frost scythe change is interesting and could remedy that. I really like frost strike being baked into glacial advance and I've thought of that exact same thing. It's silly having 2 buttons that do almost the exact same thing. 

Controversial take, I'd make breath of sindragosa a mandatory talent and have extra options on one side of the tree to make it last longer.

* You can probably sell the recipe for a few millions.
* If you switch to crafting now, you'll have zero knowledge points and won't be much profitable until you max up at least one path (e.g ring crafting), which will proably take few weeks.

* If you plan to stay for the next xpac, the start of xpac is usually a great time for gathering profession, since the mat prices are at it's highest so it's a good idea to go gathering for the first few weeks.

You'd have to be on a larger server to get a decent amount of orders. [I think in a 12 hour period I filled 50 Lariat orders earlier in season](https://pastebin.com/ezTybpec). It's a dead part of the season now so my orders look [more like this](https://i.imgur.com/i30wtVZ.png)

You can still sell the recipe for ~2m depending on the server you're on. You can also move the recipe to a large server and sell it there.

You might think you have a lot of mettle, but it disappears fast and depending how much you're charging you will make more if you just sell recipe. You'd have to spend a lot of time sitting in trade chat to get orders. 

There's also no guarantee Lariat will be good in Season 4. Blizzard might introduce/buff other embellishments and Lariat could go back to being not the best option.

It doesn't take all that much to max necks, so leveling JC isn't the issue (you could be doing 486 necks the first day). Ideally you can level new characters to cover more professions instead of just switching professions around.",2024-02-11 21:42:12,3,,2024-02-11 18:23:51.200830

LFR tier is ilvl 441 to 450 gear.

So that means you do your 3 weekly Emerald Dream weeklies for ilvl 441 to 447 gear drops to convert. Those quests have the potential to drop armor in every slot for a tier set.

Then, you run LFR and need on whatever you can (if you haven't run it lately, you'll find that you can roll need on more things than you think, even when overgeared, and it'll be ""main spec need"" rolls).

Also, by clearing LFR, you'll get 3 LFR drops to pick one from the great vault every week, even if you get nothing in the run itself.

After that, hit up M+2 through +8 runs. The gear from that range of runs all drop in the 441 to 450 range. Even if you don't get what you want, you can ask the party for drops they may not need.

You can use the item restoration service as well to see if you've vendored season 3 ilvl 441 to 450 gear that could be used to convert to LFR tier now that you're looking to get it.

Myself, I've been keeping this in mind and I've gotten gear from a variety of sources - open world, dungeons, and LFR - to build all of the Amirdrassil raid sets when I get some charges to throw away.

Well that's what Twitch drops + trading post is for. Not sure you can really complain about getting this stuff for ""free.""

So far only two TCG items have been mentioned as never going to be an option.

Also don't forget BMAH is an option for some TCG stuff, and some TCG stuff is still listed on the AH. 

> Or, is there a good way to go about reducing gold inflation?

Gold inflation happened because it's getting easier to get gold, and the game gets a year older every year (which means people get more gold).

Just explore and have fun, there's lots of stuff to do and there's no right or wrong way to play. Generally your goal would be to reach level 70 so you can join the rest of the community doing raids and Mythic+ dungeons and ranked pvp but there's no rush. You can level pretty much anywhere, yes there is fast ways to reach max level but if it's your first time I would say just explore and do whatever you want.

Some recommendations for addons:

Hekili - this addon is essentially training wheels for your damage rotation, it will tell you the next 3 abilities you should press and updates on the fly. Really handy for new players and people learning a new class/spec.

Details - this addon will tell you how much damage you're doing and it will tell you how much others are doing as well so you can compare your performance and learn what abilities are doing the most damage. 

There's thousands of addons to download but I wouldn't worry about most of them unless you have a specific need.",2024-02-11 19:05:08,10,,2024-02-11 18:23:56.039791

wow,1aoe7bm,kpyyx89,t3_1aoe7bm,notahackerpirate,/r/wow/comments/1aoe7bm/first_time_subscription_and_im_30/kpyyx89/,"Ideally, you want to play with as few addons as you feel you need. Before trying out addons, take a look at what people are doing in /r/wowui to get an idea for what you might want to try.

Also, before trying any, the first thing a new player should do is work on your keybindings so you don’t have to click your abilities.

Here’s some tips I’ve developed over the years:

- by default, A and D are turn and Q and E are strafe. You don’t need turns on keys. Hold right click for that. Put strafe on A and D, and use Q and E for abilities

Since you may want to play many classes, and a lot of classes have similar abilities, I bind Q to “move fast” on all my characters. This might be Ghost Wolf on shaman, Blink on mage, or Roll on monk.

- I bind E to my interrupt ability. All classes have interrupts, so I don’t have to rethink this for each class if I always use the same key.
- T is always mount
- Also bind R, X, V, F, G, as well as the Shift version of each key

Never feel like you are giving up or wasting time by trying out a new class. Everyone enjoys different aspects of WoW. Some people do all the hardest raids. Other people love to level all the classes or maybe even just focus on four - one of each armor type.

There’s no right or wrong way to play!",2024-02-11 19:07:56,3,,2024-02-11 18:23:56.039791

* Upgrading your pvp items does nothing for pvp as their item level is set to 473(hellbloom)/476(honor)/486(hellbloom with trophies)/489(conquest) while in pvp combat. Upgrading them does however give increased stats in pve content if you ever find yourself questing/running dungeons in your pvp gear ( I do not recommend this).
Crafted items are viable in pvp as long as you use a verdant trophy to upgrade their pvp ilvl to 489, you can wear 2 embellished items and as many non-embellished crafted items.

* Get the gems/enchants that people use on their characters by checking the resources above.

* Sockets can be applied to head, belt, bracers and rings, you can purchase those with great vault tokens (pro tip: crafted rings start out with a socket so it's usually safe to buy two 525 conquest trophies and craft those of those instead of straight up buying conquest rings).

* The elite set is acquired gradually as you climb in rating up to 1800+ (with an extra cloak, and weapon illusion enchant at 2100 and tabard at 2400, 2400 rating in any bracket also unlocks the elite version of weapons).
You can also get one ""elite"" appearance for one item from a token that you receive when hitting 1600 rating  for the first time this season on your character, you can use two of the same class/spec at 1600 to buy helm/shoulders and complete your transmog without reaching 1.8k.

A lot of the ideas felt good at the start of the expac, but I'd ultimately describe it as a failed experiment and I hope they either massively change it, or throw the idea out entirely. I don't want to see it return the same way in TWW.

A lot of people have praised DF for the fact that it moved away from the ""grindset"" and FOMO of previous expansions, and in many areas it did, but not crafting. Not at all for crafting. If you got a week or two behind in your crafting weeklies, you were permanently behind the other crafters. No catchup system was ever implemented for knowledge points beyond a couple of vendor packs they added for 1.1 and then never did again. I saw several post from new players in 10.2 and beyond asking if it was worth getting into crafting. And the honest answer is no. Unless you did it from the beginning and maxed it out, you'll never make any money from it. You could powerlevel the skills with enough money, but the knowledge points would forever hold you back.

The tiered quality system does not work for WoW. The playerbase won't allow it. Gear is either max quality or trash. So unless you can reliably max rank your craft items, then you're wasting your time. Maybe keep it for mats so that you can use HQ mats when skilling up and then basic mats when you're crafting stuff you've outlevelled, but other than that, just throw it out IMO. Just make it so you can either craft an item or you cant. If you want to keep the ""skilled crafter"" flavour, just let people who've maxed their crafts use fewer mats.

On most of my characters. I took alchemy purely for the increased phial duration and the reduced damage from the toxified phials (and IMO those things are so valuable, you almost feel pressured to take alch on any toon that uses the corrupted phial.)

In past expansions there was basically no value to having an alt who could craft gear for my main, because that alt was always further behind my main in progress, and would usually be way too late to be able to help. But now, my alt priest can craft his own gear *and* craft cloaks for my main if needed, or even just run them through the recraft for a new season of content (I normally PvP so the only thing that matters is getting the new token and recrafting it with the new season's Spark).

I like how they gave a lot more stuff to do to some of the more forgotten professions. Inscription, Jewelcrafting, Enchanting, etc. all have consistent applications now even outside of their niche, like Inscription being able to make the weekly profession skill up item (but dear god they need to make a more consistent way to learn how to make them besides super low RNG on a craft that requires mettle to make).

I love having crafted gear be relevant at a high level, and I think the token system is the perfect solution to not making it OP to just be able to buy BiS. And the embellishment limitations are also a good way to deter some of the min-maxing that happens. Main issue with embellishments is the cost of the new recipes if you don't do endgame raiding.

Biggest issues with the system is poor/no catchup mechanics, item quality making bag space a nightmare (even with a reagent bag), mettle being a limited weekly resource unless you wanna buy new recipes (my characters either have more mettle than they know what to do with, or not enough mettle to do basic crafts). I think mettle is fine as a system overall, but I think they need to make it strictly limited to being used when you are requesting a crafted item. You use your mettle for it, but any time you're crafting something for yourself, it doesn't require any. The current system only punishes alts who aren't logging in every week to pick up mettle, or aren't high enough rep with the Artisans that they only get like 60 from the weekly anyway.

Also they could do a better job of explaining how the tokens work and why embellishments are important. I know a ton of people who have no clue how much of a boon embellishments are, or how much of an advantage to the weekly gear limitations (like the conquest cap) being able to use your free PvP tokens to craft gear with is. Like as long as you have your Sparks, you'll be two pieces of gear ahead of someone only picking up their conquest gear under the cap.

Either way I hope it sticks around. I think it succeeded in a lot of what it set out to do. It just needs some more alt/new player-friendly tweaks.",2024-02-11 19:58:46,1,,2024-02-11 18:24:01.166626

wow,1aoauvu,kpzah5p,t3_1aoauvu,SilverOcean6,/r/wow/comments/1aoauvu/now_dragonflight_has_mostly_wrapped_up_how_did/kpzah5p/,"Here are my honest thoughts about professions in dragonflight, I have been very outspoken as well and come to the conclusion they are a complete and utter failure. Especially when you actually take the time to teach someone else how the system works. Let me give a few bullet points and again this is just my opinion and am more than welcome to try and have a non-hostal open discussion about it.   
  
First and foremost there should NEVER EVER be any RNG(Random Number Generator) in the crafting system. There should never be tiered mats or tiered pieces of equipment, if someone has the mats they should be able to always guarantee the max ilvl and max quality back how it was like for years prior to this expansion. While this does make it harder to make money off of, this makes it more easily available for people to obtain. There would be more incentive for people to participate in the profession system, as of right now ive given up ever participating because it's so convoluted for no reason.   
  
With more people participating in the system like it was prior to this expansion this means less people are getting frustrated spending less time finding someone and can easily ask trade chat to find someone to do it and be about their way.   
  
The cost of mats is already a high bar for some people who don't have disposable income to get tokens for gold or have a lot of time to farm the gold to get said mats. So on top of getting the mats sometimes people are at the mercy of other crafters when they ask how much it would cost them. Yes they could wait alot longer to find someone else to do a reasonable tip for or pay the extra gold to some particular person to get it done right away. And that's assuming they find someone else.  
  
Crafting should just go back to the way it was before, ill give it was never the most intersting thing and the attempts to make it “Interesting” have been abysmal to say the least with things like 24 CD crafting timers and such with mooncloth and other similar systems in the past. But that is vastly better than what we have now because in the past all we needed was the mats and the formula and that was literally it.

Those opening months in DF when no one / not many (some went hard into those Dragon insight things from chests till they nerfed it) had 100% clear meant there was decent profits as long as you specced into something with low supply. I got so much because most of the people went Weapons to dual the profession equipment so I was one of the handful of armor guys.

But post 100% needs work. Crafting margins evaporated the second people hit that and that is probably when catch ups need to kick in. Gatherers need a way to dump insight, because they can only use it for gear and then that’s that. The Work Order system needs to be able to auto buy the missing parts when applicable. Consumables (chiefly alchemy) need help, it’s often a negative to craft even if you hit 3* because it needs multicraft on top of it. There needs to not be a recipe like Lariat again with an abysmal lottery drop rate on a minor event and it be mandatory for everyone raiding. The cartels are more a ToS thing but they would have a lot less power if the amount of crafters that could make that one wasn’t *single digits*.

* No knowledge point catchup is overstated, but it is an issue. Between world treasures, first crafts, and the rep books, you can get to guaranteed 476 on at least a couple items pretty quickly, but it sucks that after that you're just permanently waaaaay behind others.
* Rare recipes blow. Full stop. JC's second ring craft is locked behind a weekly 1% drop from a world event that no-one does anymore, and its on a several hours long timer, so you can't do it at will. Horrible game design, zero redeeming qualities.

The amount of time and effort involved to get useful recipes was too much. Having most of the recipes locked behind a currency that has a weekly cap even now at the end of the expansion makes doing professions on alts way too time consuming.

And it's not obvious how to get consistent 3 star consumables and reagents. I still don't know if you're meant to be able to or if making 2 star half the time was just working as intended. So I do just buy stuff because it's simpler. Maybe that's the point to - to reward the people who put in the effort to understand it all - but it takes the fun out of it for people like me.

I have a 6700 XT and have largely not experienced the driver timeout for DX12. When you first launch WoW after a driver install or update it will idle on a black screen for 3-5 minutes. During this time, it's not actually locked up: It's building a shader cache for the game.

While I did use an official driver for a while, I switched to the AFMF preview driver (which I still use), and the ONLY time I experienced the crash was when I had an undervolt profile crash on me. Reinstalling to the standard driver triggered the crash inside and right outside of dungeons (TotT, specifically at the time), regardless if I compiled the shader or not. Once I swapped back to the AFMF preview driver and compiled it again it was fine.

A lot of AMD users are reporting the official AFMF driver (along with the long shader startup) has resolved the issue for them, though not all. I'm not daring to switch or upgrade my GPU until I'm done with CE (since I plan to stick with AMD and get a 7800 XT or 7900 XT).

It's not quite the magic bullet solution, so maybe it'll take several tries. It's annoying, but once it's working it doesn't seem to break unless you brick your driver.

[**https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-2340-01-10-preview**](https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-rad-win-2340-01-10-preview)This is the preview driver I've been using (I don't actually have a use for AFMF right now, since my PC is pretty beastly for 1440p, but it's still a nice feature to have available). The only Adrenalin setting I use is Anti-lag. It's since gone official with the 24.1.1 driver, I think. It works for some, and others still seem to have issues. Whether this is up to AMD or Blizzard to solve, I'm not sure.

As an addendum, I've seen people suggest disabling MPO, which I'd done, but whether this helps or not is uncertain.

I currently have altoholism, with the number of paladin and warlocks I have being described as “appropriate”. Part of that is that I enjoy leveling and really love paladins and warlocks. Only like 2 of each actually get end game attention. Once I’ve maxed out one of my toons I tend pickup another one I can progress with my friends. The progression and gearing is part of the fun. If you love mage (and leveling) it’s a fun way to spend time in game! I also tend to level through different zones/xpacs every time. 

If you’re looking specifically at professions for end game, I tend to slide towards enchanting + something else. This lets them turn the purples and blues into stuff you can gather onto a serious enchanting character and try to turn that time into some gold (though we’re pretty late in the xpac for that to generate a ton).

Double gathering (I usually do picking rocks and plucking flowers) are decent, and you can actually use those to level the toon while working on the professions since nodes reward xp. 

Engineering + something else can be good if you’re not looking at endgame profession value. One of the mages I have is a Dark Iron Dwarf Engineer whose focus is archaeology. He can get most anywhere in the world quite quickly between the dark iron racial, the ports, and the wormholes. Engineering also gives you tinkers, my favorite of which is the rocket boost. You also get a MOLL-E (less valuable with Katy stampwhistle and the new ohuana toy) and a Jeeves for global bank access, repairs, and vending things. A lot of my alts end up engineers, but I like the profession a lot. 

Jewelcrafting is one I will also pickup a lot. Everyone wears necks and rings, everyone needs gems cut, and a handful of older patterns/gems are valuable for twinking out some lowbie alts or things like Timewalking gear sets. 

As others mentioned it’s kind of a weird time to dig into professions for dragonflight end game, but if you’re having fun that’s what’s important.",2024-02-11 16:01:49,1,,2024-02-11 18:24:02.380935

Unfortunately, despite the large amount of posts that come up with 'solutions' to the various 'problems', none of them have been as good as what we have currently, simply due to the fact that they can be more easily abused and exploited than the current iteration. 

In fact, a lot of the suggestions that people want added are things that have already been removed because players abused them, and I honestly don't see how there is any way to 'fix it' when the current state of M+ is the way it is due to Blizzard taking on user feedback and making adjustments.

Mythics can be for learning, sure, I learned my way through M+’s tbh (my own keys). The vast majority of people doing them are people that know what they are doing and want to improve. The only way to improve, is for the game to tell you in a very kind way “here’s a lower key, go try that.” It’s also okay to just stay at a key where you’re comfortable and get really fucking good at the mechanics. You don’t always have to “push” because they allow you to downgrade the key.

I do it because I love the job. It's my responsibility to gather everything up and hold it so the team can melt it. I have the most control and duty to put things where they belong, and move them when they don't. My main focus is understanding what's happening in a fight and why, so that I can react accordingly. ""Make bar go up"" is strictly a secondary concern, and I do that after I get the mechanics on lock. 

Put another way: DPS is inwardly focused (""how can I maximize MY output?""), while tanking is externally focused (""how can manage this situation best to make the TEAM most successful?"").

Success metrics are:
1. Staying alive
2. Minimizing the number of ""oh shit"" moments created by you
3. Correcting and managing the ""oh shit"" moments created by others
4. A generalized feeling of how ""smooth"" the run goes.

Once you’ve tanked and know all the nuances and mechanics of making the fight work you’ll better understand how to make your DPS specs work with the tanks.  Tanks do that for both DPS and heals, they size up what they can handle and keep the fight to that level.  That’s why tanks have little patience with DPS who screw up the whole fight.

The people who can tank effectively are the ones who know the trash mob percentages really well. Are really good at grouping.

As group cooldowns exhaust slower pulls. Managing that alone is probably 90% of good tanking. The rest is stops. If you manage your stops poorly, you heavily rely on dps to do your stops for you.

* does not die nor have problems with surviving every single pull (excluding stuff that may not be their fault like missed interrupts or other mechanics)
* does enough damage to maintain aggro most of the time (not counting when the dps decide to unleash the Tsar Bomba in mobs before you can gain any aggro)
   * in addition to this, you need to be aware of any mob that decides you arent worth their attention anymore so you can taunt it. some tanks take way too long to notice there is a rogue mob annihilating the dps/healer and its very annoying
* (in M+) has a decent understanding of the routes so we dont spend the last 10 minutes backtracking around the dungeon looking for any mob we can kill
* can mantain a quick enough pace without going way too quick for what the rest of the group is capable of
   * this is probably the most difficult thing to learn. just because you can pull half the dungeon and survive doesnt mean the rest of the group can do that too. if the rest of the group cannot deal with so many mobs at once, most likely you wipe or make the healers life a misery

Did you accomplish most or all of those things? Then you are doing good as a tank and you dont need to be so stressed, just keep practicing.

The first moment that feels like it truly stood out is when I got to use Wild Growth for the first time. It felt extremely strong for when shit hit the fan and everyone took some damage at once.


The second one that happened is probably my peak WoW moment. It was when they rereleased the Onyxia raid, and I was in a PUG group as Feral DPS. The tanks died and I shifted to Bear and I was able to tank the rest of the fight and we got the kill.

I'm sure a lot of folks will disagree- I haven't played for a few years and I understand they've made a lot of changes.

The easiest class to learn and play though is probably beastmaster hunter. Your pet tanks for you, you do crazy damage, your rotation is basically just 3-4 abilities on a fairly short cd, and you can solo most content that would typically require 3+ people.

For healing, priests can have a pretty hard learning curve (holy is the easiest) but their solo healing is crazy. Healing groups was a bit harder, but a tank that can hold agro well and DPS that doesn't stand in fire makes for an easy dungeon/raid. And in an emergency, you can nearly insta-heal about anyone if you watch your CDs. A lot harder to do any content solo with them tho.

wow,1ao4iva,kpxqhc2,t3_1ao4iva,Apex-Editor,/r/wow/comments/1ao4iva/what_made_your_favourite_class_become_your/kpxqhc2/,"In vanilla, the game took \*ages\* to level up compared to how it does today. To get to max level it took many weeks, if not  months for most first-time players. This meant that you ended up super invested in your characters, and it was not nearly as common to have more than one or two alts of significant level as it is today. (Yes, there were, of course, outliers). Once you were at level 40, you were in too deep to quit!

I started as a warrior, and he's still my main. I stuck with it because it took ages to get him to 60, and I then jumped right into raiding with him, the only real character I had. Back then, there was also a higher barrier of advancement from raid to raid - none of this season shit. For instance, you had to kill off certain raids before you could even set foot in the next tier raid, and it wasn't based on ilvl. This meant that the character mained was the character you were most likely to *be able* to progress with, especially if you're at the competitive level, which I was when I was then.

I guess over the years it just engendered a certain bond, almost like a friendship with my character. We've spent so much time together doing everything there is to do at virtually every level, that I can't really think of having a different main. I even developed an RP headcanon for him. None of my alts have that. When I rolled a new character on another low pop server to farm rares, I chose another warrior. We're not even the best for that.

I don't know why I chose a warrior - I was 16 back then. I think it was just a random whatever decision not particularly based on much, and I knew I could switch if I wanted to. I think I was also into Drizzt do'Urden back then, so maybe that's why. I do have many alts today, but 90% of my attention goes to my main.",2024-02-11 15:01:57,3,,2024-02-11 18:24:10.307310

The last time I was playing, I was enjoying my Hunter and resto Druid the most. I think the mobility of both classes appeals to me. Most of what they do can be done on the fly, but being able to get around quickly (on foot) is nice.

—

Edit: I typed all that and didn’t answer the question.

I started with a Hunter, since I was mostly playing solo back in December of ‘04. I kept up with that for a while. I second primary alt was a fury warrior that I played in 2005. I did a fair amount of non-raid tanking. I made a shaman twink for level 29 PVP, which was amusing for a while.

I was in Germany (US army) and raiding on an east cost schedule was less than ideal. I found a guild who was a mix of other service members and their spouses, but they were all horde, on the different server.

So I remembered how much I was enjoying the twink shaman and went all in with that.

I played that guy for 8 years. Sometime during MoP, I had a lot of time on my hands and I finally got around to making a (max level) Druid. I used that mostly as a bear tank, but he slowly became my main as I wasn’t having as much fun with my shaman.

WoD rolled around and I didn’t have as much time to play. Most of my characters just sat around for a year. Legion popped up and I hated how all my main toons felt, so I just gave up for a while.

I hopped back in about 2 years ago and got my old Hunter up to the new level 60 cap (so she hit 60 first, twice). Then I ran around with various toons and did all the allied races stuff and make more alts.

I don’t enjoy the Druid tank as much anymore. It feels weird again. My fury warrior is hit or miss. It feels like my shaman’s healing is off.

So last I checked, near the end of shadowlands. I was mostly playing my Hunter and my second Druid (resto) again.

I uh, bought dragon flight 2 months ago, but barely had time to do part of the intro quests. So if and when I have time, I’ll have lots to do.",2024-02-11 18:05:24,1,,2024-02-11 18:24:10.307310

I have a belf blood death knight whos story Ive imagined for him is that he was a spellblade who fell to the scourge invasion of Quel'thalas, he was risen as a death knight and of course freed from the shackles of the lich king about the time your player character gains freedom during the dk starting zone. He's technically 2nd or 3rd wave DK, depending on timelines and retcons. But his drama is a living wife who refuses to accept his current state, and a daughter who has no idea for the longest time that her father isn't gone forever dead, just, frozen warrior of undeath dead lol. 

He makes no attempts to contact his daughter until about the events of Legion when the ebon blade takes their stand against the legion. His cause is one where his duty to the living is all that motivates him. Once a soldier always a soldier. He faces the scorn and scrutiny of the living with grace and knows that somewhere, he is doing the right thing. No matter the tricky grey area anti-hero means death knights typically find themselves in. 

He and his daughter reunite in Legion and repair their relationship going forward. He comes to learn shes become a spell breaker herself, whose main focus is centered on the reclamation of the Ghost Lands from the lingering scourge that still remain there. She has close relationships with argent crusaders and other organizations whose main focuses center on eliminating the scourge that remains unchecked in all corners of the world. Needless to say he is very proud of her and all that silly stuff. :)

But, I will try to just mention that if all characters and all races can do everything, that’s a sure way to a boring game.

Now, this might be a really old example, Warcraft 2 was such. That made people complain, so in Starcraft and Warcraft 3, Blizzard made sure races aren’t mirror images of each other.

Consider the above again, more seriously, because it is the reason for the never-ending whack-a-mole issue of balancing.

Blizzard are so committed, and many would say rightfully so, to not go back to Warcraft 2 state of affairs that they are willing to suffer doing the job and being criticized for failing at it.

While you watch their player view think of where you'd go next, what items you'd get vs what their doing - chances are  they do things you won't. Ask yourself why are they going specific items vs the draft? Analyze their gameplay and try to copy the best you can.

When you queue up for a game - go to dota2protracker.com search up the hero you chose to see the latest nerd builds.

Watch your replays.

Never flame in game regardless how retarded the team is (only flame after). Team not pulling? You pull. Team not warding? You ward. Every loss you get blame yourself and ask how you could have played it different. This mentality will help rise above the retards and will help you crawl out.

second of all you are unffair, he dedicated his time and improved original dota as far as NO ONE could with limitations of wc3 editor and game engine. he fixed that terrible last map (6.83d) and implanted soooooooooooo many game mechanic changes that icefrog did with dota 2 because he (icefrog) could'nt do with wc3 world editor because of the tool limits. namely: improving command delay which in icefrog maps time we had to do with a third party software (wc3dr) implanting build in warkeys and so so much more custom options. changing UI for easier navigation and implanting talent tree and Tp's into UI. and now you can see EVERY little Detail about your hero and its states ( i mean EVERYTHING) in old icefrog dota you could'nt even see your own attack speed or regen ...

and he didn't just improve map he updated it with new heroes new items new skins new models even. and so many more features that i may not remember all. emotion stickers and emojies , sound chat wheel , auto chat commands, more game options , more visual options, improved mini map with options to customzation , and keybounding for EVERYTHING you can think of in the game.

Attention: im not saying you CAN'T find any glitches in his map BUT when you compare couple visual glitches and some minor bugs that have very little impact to the game with icefrog one, the one with more that dozen major game breaking bugs (Hello Lycan , Spirit breaker & Perma Linken's Bug) , you must be thankful that someone with far more potential came to surface to fix and update our beloved game.(or game map)

in the end i want to say he dedicated himself and his time for us and our childhood legacy game. . . least we can do is not ruin his effort and wonderful job with spreading misinformation and just be happy about the fact that we still can play that epic map with our friends instead of that last icefrog's full of bugs and glitches map. othewise original dota would be dead log time ago.",2022-11-12 14:57:54,1,,2024-02-11 18:24:34.910419

But what clock does is so much better on a position 4 or 5 vs a 3. Every time you have like a sick clock play, really consider and think to yourself, what would have prevented you from doing that as a 4 or 5?

Most of the time in even games 3 clock is a worse position to be in vs an actual offline hero. Clock can definitely stomp from the 3 position, but all heroes technically could, specifically the lower ranked the game.

A lot of 3 position heroes do different things in lane. Clock basically ganks. You ult in and break up a team while securing a kill. Why do you need to be in the offline, or an offline hero, for to achieve that? Dark Seer pushes the lane hopefully eventually overwhelming the carry. You need the be in the lane and you want the enemy carry the struggle and you're gonna want items before you really get into team fighting. Clock wants to fight, items might help. But not nearly as much as continuing to fight and disrupt the opposing teams ability to have a easy/good game.",2024-02-12 00:12:08,8,,2024-02-11 18:24:37.141991

Even in higher MMR games most team's won't group and end/pressure objectives fast enough against scaling pos 2 heros to prevent massive min25-30 powerspikes.


Sniper, OD, tiny(when in meta), lone druid and a few other pos 1/2 flex picks all have counter-intuitive power spike timings.


Solo Q pubs won't normally gank these heroes appropriately because they perceive their strength to be higher than it actually is due to these heroes strong lane phases but unless they're considerably fed at the 12-20 minute marks they're all awkwardly building into their first big item post lane phase because these heroes need to scale after their early strong lane phase abilities start to fall off/require more strong item utility to stay relevant. 


(Sniper is strong in lane with treads and wraith bands but needs to hit his timings for a midgame pike & dmg/farming item, Arc needs to get his first real item around the same timing after investing early into a midas, OD similar to arc if he went midas he has to go farm to hit his timings on fighting items for the mid game, tiny needs his aghs after his blink echo so he can maintain kill threat once the enemy builds answers for his ava toss combo)


During this 12-25 minute period in the game (assuming normal farming patterns and timings)
Is when your team with a pos 2 that has a more traditional tempo for scaling can group with your team and put pressure on the map because teams with farm hungry lane winning pos 2s will typically be left in a 3v5 position while both their 1 and 2 are in a race against the clock to clear jungle camps and stay/become relevant and you pressuring them puts the 1 and the 2 in a position where they both have to choose between:


1. Stop farming/also potentially die compounding lost time to join the team and protect early objectives to maintain map control while they aren't strong yet 


or


2. Continue farming hoping your team can hold all the t1s/t2s/rs pit without you and another core so you don't risk getting baited out of hitting your timings and becoming a liability later in the game.


If you can group and take over the map early enough against pos2 heroes like Arc they'll typically not be strong enough to contest teamfights and end up losing or being stuck on their high ground, not farming efficiently always late for their next powerspike.


That all being said, Arc is a go to hero for smurfs because if he can abuse his MMR gap during the lane phase to get kills on the enemy pos2 he can snowball past the point of the match where he'd normally be transitioning into his lategame powerspike and start playing aggressively much sooner.",2024-02-11 20:55:58,1,,2024-02-11 18:24:45.147842

Honestly, when you see Ogre picked, you know he gonna rush boots, midas and then probably Aghs ans HOT. His job is to be there in the fight taking hit and stuning everyone while bloodlust his allies and make a huge difference with dots. 

When i play Ogre i go like this, then get Lens, hex, lotus, Big support items who make huge difference late game. You Can have a lot of golds with him so you aim different. But i'm not a pro Ogre since i don't like him as a 5 with melee carry.

Lion Aghs is a joke i think. I rather having a sucking mana lion with NO SUPPORT items, than having that insane nuke. It makes no different. Even if Lion is a top sup rn, when i'm against him it's so easy, i won most of my recent games against. 

People want to enjoy their games and deal a lot of damage, they don't want to support, they don't understand what's a support. They don't understand most of support are insane without items, i don't play carry cause i usually feel alone, when i'm support i know i gonna do everything to enable my carry and that's what's makes me happy.

DotA2,1aoabl2,kpxuo8f,t3_1aoabl2,-Exy-,/r/DotA2/comments/1aoabl2/viper_offlane/kpxuo8f/,"bots is highly situational as an offlane, treads make your laning much stronger since viper needs attack speed. Generally you get wraith band / double wraith band / wraithband + wand into treads mageslayer and from there you figure out if you want early magic damage with veil into shiva or if you can't frontline / others are frontlining you go dragon lance. Maelstrom can be good building into gleipnir for some control, eventually you also get a hurricane pike. I would rarely go bkb on viper unless it's absolutely necessary, manta is better.

Late game you can get basically anything you want / the team needs. Skadi, butterfly, AC, bloodthorn, blink etc

There's no reason to ever skip mageslayer on viper as it gives you EVERYTHING you like: magic resistance, attackspeed and mana regeneration. Even if they don't have that much spell damage (which is rare) on the enemy team it still cancels blinks for 9 seconds

One trick I like to do with viper is if you ever find yourself in a situation where you win a fight and you could push highground, you can instantly buy shard and fly it out and it can often make the difference between getting one set of rax or two of them",2024-02-11 15:26:52,3,,2024-02-11 18:24:52.990537

Build is pretty much the same.

2wraith bands + sages mask for early mana regen.

Treads + dragon lance +mageslayer then finish pike.

After that you can either go manta or linkens or basically anything you want really.

Btw i dont really see the need to buy bots early as a offlane viper. U can buy it later. Treads early just feels way better imo

hands down my most favorite game they’ve made honestly. you get to use pretty funny emotes, maps are great + 12V12 and you have your face off maps 6v6! so fun and almost makes you feel like you’re in cracked out mode. 

you also get knife fight, sticks and stones and prop hunt! all such great party modes which always kept me from getting bored of the game. its always nice being able to switch up instead of the game feeling repetitive. 

my most favorite part was the amazing round base they have AND zombies outbreak! it’s all so fun and you can play for hours!

Most often the coincidentally low-level accounts who often play those hyper snowballers with only intro bot games in their history, when checking.

Not into wanting to play daycare for the mentally ill no life smurf players on my team who get shat on in their elo who sweat entitlement after work. Such games easily account for a third of my losses, though some of them might have been lost without running it down still.

But it is okay. If Riot tolerates Smurfs, then there's little integrity in having a ranking mode. Wish they pulled a Dota2.

mid annie, vex

jg yi, vi, warwick

trundle is good because you get a lot more macro experience and his matchups are very similar to each other, and late game is always just split push. You will start to learn how to maximize your annoyance on the map which shows league in a different light that you can win without headbutting everyone, being the uncatchable constant macro threat that neutralizes a losing game.

Very easy to repeat over and over which means very easy to learn. You want very middle of the road vanilla champions with decent matchups and no bags of tricks, of which all of those are. Practicing the same strategy over and over until that strategy gets harder and harder is the easiest way to learn, aim to be the best trundle or whatever in silver, then gold, then plat etc.

otherwise, play what you think is fun, just be honest whether or not you want to actually improve and rank up or if you just enjoy the game. Those are two valid things, pretending one is fun to you while ignoring the other will hurt your total enjoyment.

It is like, do you enjoy working out or do you want to be a body builder? Just figure out what your real goals are and be honest about what you would need to do to achieve them. Sacrificing champ pool is one of those things. I'd say if you are struggling below plat with 450K riven points, its probably not clicking for you mechanically, try something that is easier to digest in review where playing mechanically well is both much easier and also much easier to review honestly.

Riven has very tight timings in combos that are very difficult to tell if something was played appropriately, even for masters+ players, of which there is an ocean of improvement left to reach diamond 4 from silver 1. If you can't tell if you did something incorrectly, it is literally impossible to fix the mistake.",2024-02-11 23:55:17,1,,2024-02-11 18:27:32.939900

Since you have been playing for only 2 months, the correct answer in terms of winrate, is to play the champion you're best at. Your job in order to improve at this game is to learn as much as possible from your games. This is more important than picking a champion regardless of team comp.

Or maybe you're more interested in playing for fun than improving, in which case, the correct answer is to play the champion you enjoy the most.

To your question, riot released statistics a long time ago that stated that the optimal amount of tanks on a team was 2, with a team comp of 0 tanks having the lowest winrate, a team of 1 tank having a significantly improved winrate, and a team of 3 going back to negative winrate. Whether these stats are still perfectly adequate multiple seasons later is debatable, but I can confidently say that your team having at least *one tank* is mandatory for your comp to not suck.

As for counterpicks, as a jungler, you don't have to worry about them as much as top lane, but you'll learn over time the matchups that do well into your opponent's picks. If the enemy toplaner picks Shen for example, you may counterpick him with Nocturne. If your team has no AP, you may pick Brand. If the enemy team is all AD auto attackers, you may pick Rammus.

Nocturne is a fantastic jungler to pick and very strong in the current meta so feel free to keep OTPing him.

To climb in the game in general I recommend you pick THREE champions you enjoy the most, and focus on playing them. Don't get caught up too much about what your team is picking or what the enemy team is picking, and focus on picking what YOU are strong with. Being good at your champ automatically a counterpick to all your enemies who aren't.",2024-02-11 22:06:58,18,,2024-02-11 18:27:41.640633

Nocturne hates playing into tanks he cannot kill while he cannot easily ignore them (think Sion, Rammus, or Zac) or champions with high mobility (Talon, Akali, Ahri, Kayn). 

He's extremely good into almost every AD jungler which is why he's strong right now, and he's decent into most AP junglers (however almost every AP jungler outscales him). He does well into almost every support (Rakan, Pyke, Thresh, and Alistar are ones I'd avoid). He's great into most mid laners since they usually only have one safety spell that you can spell shield (think TF W, Xerath E, Syndra E, Annie/Vex passive), and he's good into most regular AD top laners. Nilah is probably the only adc that hard counters you since there's a way to kill every other adc.

You want to pick Rammus to punish full AD team comps, since it makes his itemization great and the other team can't kill him easily. Brand works best into short range melees who can't threaten him well once he gets Liandry's + Rylais.

Ultimately it's about understanding your champions's strengths and weaknesses. It's best to think about how your champion counters the other team comp compared to how it fits into yours, but you still want to at least maintain some synergy with your team's champions.",2024-02-11 22:34:38,2,,2024-02-11 18:27:41.640633

\-1 AP champion is optimal, 2 is sub-optimal, 3 or more is troling, enchanters/morgana or tanks with ap base damage like Zac or Ornn aren't included.

\- 5 AD is sub optimal but still viable if the enemy lacks a tank

It's best to communicate to your team if you intend to pick an ap/ad champ before ban phase starts if you intend to play a carry champ, you don't really need to counter pick to succeed in jungle as its the role with the least ""opposing role"" interaction.

With that out of the way, about team compositions and how they work in champ select:

in champ select its important to pick champions that synergize well with each other, they should work under a similar archetype in order for them to have that synergy. If your comp has bad synergy your team is likely to lose so making a comp that all has the same goal in a teamfight can be huge.

There are 3 main archetypes: Dive, Poke and Front-to-back

**Dive** is the easiest archetype to play, it consists of champions that want to create a chaotic teamfight where the enemy team can't work together. Champions with strong gap closing abilities that can ignore the front line or champions with a ton of burst/upfront damage are very strong dive champions, think of all assassins, Olaf, Azir, Samira, Nautilus, Orianna, Maokai and Rammus (his ult makes him incredible at diving). Dive counters Poke

**Poke** is the most complicated archetype, it sounds easy on paper, your goal is to use your long range abilities to whittle down your opponents health bar before going in to get the kills or just straight up killing them from afar. However it's difficult to stay just far enough from your opponents reach and close enough that you can reliably hit your skillshots, champions like: Jayce, Corki, Lethality varus and Senna are great at poking. you often pair poke champs with 1 or 2 strong anti-dive champs like Janna, Zyra or Karma.

In the right hands Poke is almost unbeatable, even against Dive however its much easier to lose even from a winning position so playing consistently well is a must.

**Front-to-back** is the simplest (but not easiest) archetype and focuses on 2 things: first, the front line creates space and protect their backline by using their tankiness, base damage and cc and second, the back line takes that space and uses it to dish out absurd amounts of damage.

Great frontline champions include: Braum, Ornn, Alistar and Taric and Maokai

Great backline Champions include: most adcs excluding Samira and Nilah, Azir, Akshan, Orianna and Kayle

You may have noticed some champions are present in multiple archetypes and that's because they have a kit that can work in that space. Varus can go on-hit or lethality, Azir can use his sand soldiers to dps or as a means to land a shurima shuffle and so on. most champions have the ability to fit into multiple archetypes, what they can do and what you should pick accordingly will get better as you play the game and understand its champions.

Ultimately as a player you also have the ability to decide what the comp can be depending on your pick order. picking first gives you a lot more autonomy on shaping the comp than if you were picking last but you also have to keep in mind that you can't control your team so they may or may not choose champions that fit with the style of play you have in mind. The best way to get around this as a jungler is to simply play around the side that does adhere to the archetype you want to play and go from there.",2024-02-11 22:19:18,2,,2024-02-11 18:27:41.640633

Though in the rare times you get to be pick 4/5, its pretty simple, generally you won't pick vs the enemy jungler, and so you'll want to basically fill in the gaps the team might have. No tank?

1. The first thing is Shacos cannot neutralize Karthus short of lucky and aggressive invades. He can specifically out gank Karthus early on.
2. Shaco killing karthus in a fight doesnt affect the end outcome of the fight much since karth passive+ult.
3. Shaco has high risk ganks often leaving him on low hp even if successful allowing him to easily be killed by R after.
4. Karthus benefits even more from this since a good shaco will gather bounties and karth can collect that bounty easily even against a good shaco
5. Karthus scales in a way that is hard to stop
6. Shaco scales in a way that is easier to stop
7. Most shaco players do not know how to properly capitalize or solidify their lead
8. Karthus can win from behind or with a lead
9. Karthus is more useful in teamfights and globally where as shaco can struggle later to have an impact.
10. Lastly Karthus vs assasins depending on your build if you are a good player only bothers you early game. After that is not that hard to avoid em or counter build or do good trades.

Semi-unrelated but I am one of the first shaco support mains and karthus bot mains too. I can tell you in general its just easier to pull off a Win in a rough game with Karthus in any game plat or below. You can do amazing things with shaco and not be able to carry.",2024-02-11 21:02:03,121,,2024-02-11 18:27:45.952758

Shaco killing Karthus in a fight doesn't stop Karthus from impacting the fight, removing a large strength of Shaco as an assassin. Pretty much meaning he gotta go for other squishies instead which makes him more predictable. Karthus can win from behind and there is always that feel of ''wait forever and Karthus will carry late game'' that Shaco will just fold to unless you snowball hard early on. 

The only thing worthy of note in favour of Shaco is that they can dodge Karthus R with the Shaco R but that is a pretty bad usage of the clone since Shaco wants to ult early in the fight but Karthus wants to ult at the end of the fight or while dead.",2024-02-11 23:04:21,21,,2024-02-11 18:27:45.952758

Later on you kind of just press E and Shaco just loses half his HP for trying to get near you. That's not even to mention how Shaco is one of the worst farming junglers, and Karthus is the fastest. 

To give some context I'm normally a Masters 100 LP jungler but I completely ran a challenger Shaco OTP. He really couldn't do anything when his gank attempts before 5 minutes failed. If Shaco doesn't make the game doomed at 5 minutes it's just near unwinnable for him.

Now that said in my experience AP Shaco on the other hand takes a hard dump on Karthus. Shaco doesn't use his Q to specifically go on Karthus and the boxes can be very annoying to navigate around, especially later on in the game.

In general though, assassins that go in and rely on stealth to navigate a fight are typically bad into Karthus. Kha'zix is the other assassin that I'd say Karthus counters. Assassins (in jungle) that want to farm to 6 to get their powerspike are the hardest for Karthus because your ult isn't great in 1v1 combat while other ults are, which is most notably Evelynn and Rengar. You can get around most assassin matchups by getting an early Zhonyas, though it's a bit more nuanced than that.",2024-02-12 00:56:46,1,,2024-02-11 18:27:45.952758

Onetricks.gg will show you match and build histories for high elo one tricks on any given champion which is usually a good place to start if you want to imitate a successful player.

Fiora, Fizz, and Kassadin are all fine in the current meta.

As far as general game changes if you just go to YouTube and type something like ""all changes in League of Legends Season 14"" you will get plenty of videos where people will list it all out for you. That should catch you up on everything except new champions. Those you can read about anywhere but as I'm sure you know playing against them or as them is probably the best way to get familiar with them.

What you experienced is just what our human beings in the real world are like. 

Some people are just toxic. In some places you can find even more toxic behaviour than what you experienced in league. 

What makes you feel particularly bad in league is that the game matches you with people from everywhere. You no longer belong to a defined place as you are in your real life. 

For example, you maybe are a student in a highly regulated school where your teachers and headmasters are so tough on behaviour issues. You hardly see any toxic behaviours in your school whilst those drunken and drug addicted at another corner of the society can be more toxic than what you can imagine. But, you don’t go there in your real life. 

Or, you maybe are a white collar upper class elite working in the finance industry, where everyone is just polite and gentle to each other at your level. You hardly see any toxic behaviours in your business whilst those drunken and drug addicted at another corner of the society can be more toxic than what you can imagine. And again, you don’t go there in your real life. 

Now, you play league online. 

A person in your team can be one of those drunken and drug addicted. They are free to install the game, and play it, and got matched in a ranked game. Just like what you do. The game system brings them to you.

When these expectations are not met, they become irritable. 

The motive for toxicity boils down to a couple things. 

1. Some toxic players think that being harsh on their team will, in theory, make them correct their mistakes and play better.

2. League is anonymous. It’s like road rage, but with literally zero risk to anyone’s safety. That encourages people to act more rashly.

3. Frustration. People are mean and angry when they are tilted.

4. The time spent in a losing game often feels like such a waste of that time and your “talent”. 

5. Lack of control over the outcome of your game. The only thing people have control over is what they do, so it often makes them feel better to make their teammates have as equally terrible of a time as they are having.

6. The nature of losing in league is different than other aspects of life, because everyone’s mistakes are on broad display for you to watch as the match state disintegrates into a loss.

Same for botlane. What happens when the botlaner is playing Ezreal with a twitch support and farms under tower really well in the 1v3 but their entire team loses on the rest of the map. They would get punished massively even though they played really well but couldnt do anything.

>Why does the system not use KDA and other similar stats instead of Elo/MMR systems?  
>  
>League of Legends is a team game and teams win or lose games together. We don’t want to impose an arbitrary system of rating players on performance because then the best way to beat that system would probably be to get good scorelines, rather than helping the team win.  
>  
>We want to reward good play that ultimately leads to a win, no matter how small their impact may seem. Supports sacrificing themselves to save their ADC, tanks zoning three enemies in a teamfight, or assassins diving the backline to blow up the carry are all examples of plays that may not make a great statline but help get the W. Some champions have unique playstyles (think Singed/Nunu) that would be tough to measure, and their mains may not be graded appropriately based on their play.

Or when Bds is winning then killing them. Doing this abuse to try to break their confidence.

Make sure you have the setting that prioritizes enemies closer to your cursor enabled so that you don’t start shooting a minion or plant that’s closer to your champ when you miss an enemy hitbox and click the ground. I also suggest you bind the toggle target champions only setting to a mouse button if you have it. This allows it so that when fights get messy in lane or jungle etc. you can click near or on top of enemy champs and not worry about accidentally targeting creeps which can often be a throw.

There's a billion things to learn and it's all just gonna be overwhelming and confusing until you can start to put pieces together and get a hang of basic mechanics.

I could sit here and type out for you all the different aspects of the game that you'll need to start picking up (like that google doc the other guy posted) but it's not probably gonna be very practically useful for you.

If you have someone to play with who's got a bit more experience, I'd recommend playing the game together so that they can answer any questions you have in the moment (preferably someone who won't get impatient after the thousandth ""what the fuck just happened"" question), because learning about stuff that's immediately in front of you and applicable right in that moment is gonna help it stick a lot better than just hearing or reading about it divorced from context.

Play lots of bot games, there are zero stakes involved and it's a good way to just get a hang of how the map works, how to pilot your character around, and just get a grip on the mechanics. There's no shame in it, and jumping straight into matchmade games with how few genuinely new players are still just starting out is just gonna be a bad time, because there are gonna be a ton of smurfs and new accounts from banned players (who are *very* toxic) that will ruin the experience.

Watch champion spotlights if you see a champ do something cool or that you don't understand and want to lean about. Sit and read item descriptions and ability descriptions for as long as you need to until they start to make sense. You don't have to worry about sprinting out there and trying to win as fast as possible, your teammates might but they can be safely ignored. Again, bot games have *zero* stakes.

Mute anyone who starts to show even a hint of being an unpleasant person, or disable chat outright. Arguing with anyone is always a waste of time, chat is almost always a net negative experience, but I like to keep mine on and just mute people so I can tell my teammates ""gj"" when they make a good play or ""ty"" when they help me out.",2024-02-11 17:04:17,8,,2024-02-11 18:28:10.748165

leagueoflegends,1aoce23,kpyx81j,t3_1aoce23,The_Guy_13,/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1aoce23/overwhelmed_new_player/kpyx81j/,"Best advice for new players is to just play the game to figure out what is going on. You can’t expect to learn everything overnight so unfortunately you’ll have to put the time in learning the basics. If you want an idea of what to focus on. The most important thing you need to learn as a new player is champions and champion abilities. This is very daunting considering there are 167 champions right now with new ones being added pretty regularly. I always suggest to just learn by doing so that people don’t get burned out researching every single champion’s q,e,w,r and passive. As you’re playing make note of what abilities you see your teammates and enemies using. If an ability seems confusing or isn’t obvious, you can go look at their kit in the champion pool later which will show you exactly what it does and it’s range. It is very important that you know what people can and can’t do. Many abilities require some kind of counter play to them when they are cast. Additionally cooldowns are integral to this game where some champs literally will not fight without certain abilities off cooldown. If you know someone just used an ability with a long cooldown you can abuse that to hurt them more than they can hurt you. This should be your first and main focus. You can’t expect to be good at chess if you don’t know how the pieces move and the same is true for league.

Some people recommend playing against bots, I really think it’s a waste of time or just less efficient. If you play with people they’ll inadvertently teach you the game by how they play. AFAIK bots don’t understand macro which is more important than anything in league so you’ll be handicapping yourself by observing bots. Instead try and notice how ppl in your lobby play. If your laner beats you try to notice what they did better than you. Did they have more cs? Did they get more kills? Were they positioned better leading them to less deaths? Small things like that. For new players macro gets confusing so I’ll give you a general rule to follow. Usually early game which is before 15- 20 min or before the first towers fall, people sit in lane to last hit minions slowly getting stronger. You don’t really want to be running around the map too much at this point. After towers fall waves can get pushed further up lanes giving more time for ppl to roam. Generally you want to make sure enemies and minions are not hitting your towers then you are free to group up. If you try to stay around your teammates you’ll probably be okay. 

There is a lot to learn in league so don’t get discouraged but be aware it will be a while before you see results. Imo order of importance should be controlling your character, champion abilities, macro, then items/runes, and finally micro so that’ll give you an idea of progression. You’ll learn faster if you watch videos as well so look for some guides on champions you’d like to play that might give laning tips so you win your lane.",2024-02-11 18:58:35,2,,2024-02-11 18:28:10.748165

However, as a player with poor skills and mental fortitude, I can say that my frustrations do not stem from a lack of fun.

For instance, it is common to see a player on an engage champion attempt to make a play repeatedly, only to have their ranged carries focus solely on trading or stand far away, often under tower, waiting for a wave to push to them.

What I find truly unpleasant is not the setback or the defeat, but the complete absence of communication or teamwork in a multiplayer game, and the negative responses that follow - which I myself have contributed to at times.

> Yeah there was a 5% chance of winning the game but there is a 50% chance of winning the next one.

So you give up the 5% chance to win 50 LP (because you lose -25 when you surrender and gain +25 when you actually win instead) at no cost, to just 50% +25/-25 and stand still? There's no question there, you actually stand to gain something from that surrendered game where as from 50% winrate new game you don't.

For you to have less than 5% chance to win, the game doesn't last another 20 minutes. If it lasted another 20 minutes, you had way more than 5% chance to win. If the enemy can't actually close, there you go.

As for surrender rates there's a few things you need to keep in mind:

* Surrendering after getting aced when you know the enemy is about to end is counted the same as any surrender. It's impossible to tell when those people surrendered. Higher elo players know when the enemy is about to end after an ace.

* If players don't play to climb and just play to play, they will surrender. Doesn't mean it's a smart decision. They might've reached their goal or cap and don't care anymore to optimize a climb.

* In Korea they play in PC cafes (Bangs) a lot, so they're pressured by that to make decisions that might not be in the interest of climbing but having more fun and gameplay they like.

If you're climbing at 55% winrate in that elo, it takes 20 games to make a 2 win difference (lets call it 50 LP). 11-9. By surrendering you're giving up the chance to get that 50 LP at no risk to you since worst case you'll lose anyway but since you were going to surrender it's not any worse. You can try to get that 50 LP in 5-10 minutes. Sure you have a low chance but considering it takes 20 fucking games to get that normally, you only need a low chance. If games + queue are 30 minutes and you stay there for 10 extra minutes, you only need to win 1/60 of those games for it to be worth time wise. That's like 1.6% win chance. Even the biggest stomps have at least 2% if you search winrates by gold leads.

Surrendering is just not a smart decision. The type of people that would surrender can't understand or don't want to understand math. Like the type of idiots that do gambling.",2024-02-11 16:56:59,5,,2024-02-11 18:28:11.997493

Renekton i don't know much about, but Rhaast got screwed hard since they balanced him around Omnivamp existing. Maybe just give him built in Omnivamp scaling with levels or something so that in case if they make AD omnivamp next season they can just remove it.

i only play aram, gore was my prefered riven/lee item

also sometimes used it on zed graves xin kayn j4 fiora, and theres a handful of other champions i dont play at all but i wouldve been building it on as well

its really rough playing these champs without the boost from gore, now you need several other items to compensate (still need the tiamat, but now you also need sundered steraks etc) and as youve said not all of these champions are great at auto attacking to make the sundered work

speaking of items that are substantially worse this patch (again for arams) heartsteel, barely gives any health from what youre able to stack over the course of a game unlike last set

a ton of champions and builds that used to work thanks to liandries/demonic just dont now

divine sunder missing hurts a few champs, katarina warwick off the top of my head, theyre not unplayable but theyre worse to itemize for now

stopwatch being gone hurts in some ways, seekers is too much of an investment sometimes

warmogs nerfed to require even more bonus health hurts

Pretty much all mechanics have been revised.  
  
\*Gunplay is less dependent on luck,  
movement is much more fluid and dynamic than ever before  
Vehicles are no longer unstoppable killing machines but you have to take a more tactical approach.  
\*BF V brought so many new and refreshing ideas to the franchise:  
Squad reinforcements, fortifications, full customization of your soldiers + vehicles, supply stations at the flags for ammo/health and many other changes.  
\*It must be said, however, that many of the features have been downgraded over the years due to community outcry. Which I personally found very unfortunate.  
  
\*Back then I played the first ever close alpha from BFV on Narvik. and was totally amazed at how much more hardcore and better the gameplay was compared to BF 1.  
Personally, I would really like to see a next BF with most of the features from BF V.",2024-02-11 21:04:39,14,,2024-02-11 18:28:45.248323

Battlefield,1ao7jbf,kpxhn70,t3_1ao7jbf,AkelsMaster,/r/Battlefield/comments/1ao7jbf/new_battlefield/kpxhn70/,"My next dream battlefield release.

I would really like a battlefield release that focuses more on naval stuff and combat on Islands.

Think naval strike but expanded.

This can of course be part of a new Battlefield game that focuses not only on this but makes this like a separate part of the game or something.

With maps, vehicles and weapons in Battlefield 4 style.

They should just keep the gun play like it was in Battlefield 4 when it was fixed because that was when gunplay was the best and it has never been better since then IMO.

I would also really like to see some more naval stuff. Maybe a map somewhere in the Pacific. With some tiny Islands, but most of it would be water and 2 or 3 big carriers with conquest points on them And you would have like 2 cruisers or destroyers you can actually drive and would offer tank like capabilities but on the water ( multiple primary weapon types and weapon stations etc). They would be very powerful but they would only be able to move on the outskirts of the map and not in the tight waterways in the middle of the map. And then scattered throughout the map would be anti-ship missile stations or multiple types of smaller boats ( just like with land vehicles in Battlefield 2042: ifv, anti air, sea mine laying boats) you could spawn in with anti-ship missiles, that can take down a big ship in three hits. They have already done something similar in Battlefield 1 so I think it should be able to work. It could also be a separate mode in the game with its own set of coastal maps, like the coasts of California, Hawaï, Japan and China.

I would also like them to add commander mode back. Have a voice chat system that encourages people to use voice chat in a hierarchical manner. Each squad would have its own voice chat And the leaders in the squad would be in their own voice squad channel but also have a channel with all other squad leaders and the commander they can switch between.

None of this replacing AI with players as the server fills, 64 AI per-team means more enemies to fight. they wouldn't be worth the same XP as killing a player would but more enemies are more enemies. Then program the AI to prioritize deploying to objective areas of the map with the least amount of players within a certain area of the objective. When deploying the AI will spawn in teams of Ten in AI controlled transport choppers or transport trucks. Once at an objective the AI should then begin capturing the objective area while building fortifications (like in BF1) then holding the area against a counter attack. This capturing of an objective would draw players away from the main area of player fighting and spread players across the map. This would fill the ENTIRE map with players and allow the flow of battle to rotate, eb, and flow back and forth.

On a side note, while not worth the same amount of XP, could you imagine shooting down a helicopter full to the brim with enemy AI, the AI pilots, and the AI gunners? BOOM 13 dead and you stopped an assualt on an objective sight. Or ambushing an enemy AI transport convoy of a couple transport trucks and enemies. Tons of XP and fun moments.

US gets more tanks and quick tank respawns. Germans only get two tanks and no respawns. US tanks just need to rush and overpower one tank at a time until the Germans don’t have any. After that the US has a pretty strong advantage. 

The problem is that most of your “professional” tankers are too afraid of losing a tank to do this, and if one does go aggressive the others still don’t.

Smoke helps to give cover for reviving teammates and giving cover to move but that's about it. Most players are smart enough to not rush through it and people running into it become blind.

Plus smoke makes it hard to shoot at the enemy if you throw too much of it. In my experience on Providence Breakthrough, the attacking team MUST use their tanks to their advantage. I've had numerous matches where I had successful flanks around the sector and helped infantry push in.

I don't understand why people have trouble thinking strategically. A lot of people seem to think that simply rushing at the enemy will work but it doesn't. You have to think about critical targets and what poses the biggest threats.

Take out the Anti-Tank Stationary guns to help friendly tanks move up. Take out Stationary Machine Guns to support infantry. Then finally, take out the enemy tanks and your able to pound the enemy infantry but make sure to flank on either the far left or far right.

If you deploy smoke for cover and the enemy hasn't seen you yet, what the fuck do you think is gonna happen when an enemy suddenly sees a cloud of smoke showing up out of nowhere? Now you've exposed yourself and they know to expect you to attack.",2024-02-11 09:39:32,3,,2024-02-11 18:30:53.074010

In BF4, tapping the ADS button will deploy the bipod and lock you into place. In BFV, bipods will auto deploy if you are in a position to bipod. You can tell when they've deployed by a small animation of your character flicking the bipod into position and your weapon becoming more centered on the screen. Your hip fire accuracy will also show an increase. Bipods in BFV are pretty forgiving and will deploy quite easily, so you may be having an issue. I'm pretty sure you can toggle the bipod and if you do it won't deploy until you retoggle it. I'm not sure what button it is as they're no reason to use it, but maybe try that and see if it fixes your issue.

People may have different experiences depending on the time of day, region, or game mode. I recommend Breakthrough. Partly just because it feels like an actual battle, but also because it’s usually balanced, and one of the quickest ways to develop skills as infantry. In my opinion at least. BFV’s maps can be massive, but in Breakthrough they are broken into sectors which you either need to take or defend. Since the map is cut up like that usually there is a higher density of players.

BattlefieldV,1amsec0,kpop6jo,t3_1amsec0,TheDoc321,/r/BattlefieldV/comments/1amsec0/i_need_help_getting_back_into_bfv/kpop6jo/,"Even though I bought BFV at release, I'm a relative newb. My PC wouldn't run it very well, so I basically just quit bothering with it. My son gives me his hand-me-downs when he upgrades his PC, so with a ""new"" GPU, CPU, and extra RAM, I was good to go.

Being a long-time vet of BF4, I actually found BFV to be easier in terms of overall play. I like the more ""hardcore"" elements (limited spotting, short TTK, etc.) but there are some aspects that are worse (armor being overpowered).

I play conquest almost exclusively as assault, but I think the same principals apply no matter the game mode.

1) Find a weapon you're comfortable with and get your sensitivity settings dialed-in to your liking. Some people like to start with a less sensitive setup then increase the sensitivity as they progress.

2) If you play a map enough, you will see patterns develop in terms of the flow of traffic. People are creatures of habit, and you will see choke points develop. Use that to your advantage. Getting killed should be a lesson on what not to do. Take notes.

3) Aim for the head. This game rewards head-shots greatly. If you aim for the head and miss, at least you're hitting the enemy in the upper regions of the body.

4) Find *creative* defensive positions. Some might call this ""camping"". Those people are just mad that you killed them. Stay there until they figure it out then move somewhere else.

5) If you're playing medic, great, medics in BFV are so valuable. Utilize the smoke grenades/launcher and be a hero. Don't do it blindly and put yourself in a vulnerable position though. Some players are selfish and will call for a rez even if they have an enemy sitting over them.

6) Just play. Try not to get discouraged and try to keep it fun.

Good luck!",2024-02-09 20:27:27,3,,2024-02-11 18:31:31.075988

Check your mini map constantly, when you see your team building a push, go prone behind your team and let the enemy try and repel you, GUN THEM DOWN. Obviously easier on defense. I get top of the leaderboard 80% of the time doing this. Another thing, if you’re constantly checking your minimap, look for tanks spotted. Respawn as assault and give him hell. Even if he kills you , you distracted him. Same thing with planes. Planes will bomb the shit out of you and kill your teams advances no doubt. First they’ll blow up your tanks, then wreck infantry, so don’t be afraid to hop on the AA and use the engineer trait ( you can shoot for longer). Hop inside your teammates tanks more often.

Played at launch for quite a while and then stopped for over three years till around eight weeks ago. Have a hundred odd hours at BF1 and I did some of the really old ones too at some point. So I’m not an elite level expert but certainly have a decent amount of experience.

In my opinion it wouldn’t hurt you to gain some knowledge from YouTube. There’s plenty of good people with various types of things you could soak up. Lots of tips and tricks etc.
I would say I have by far improved my gameplay in the last eight weeks since coming back and am better now than when I used to play and I am older with slower reactions and what not and had to remember how to do everything lol. 
The biggest two things for me that have been an absolute game changer compared to how I used to play have been getting my game settings exactly feeling right with my controller for aiming (plus all the other million settings) and adding the use of leaning left and leaning right which I mapped to paddles on my elite controller. While doing this I move from cover to cover and try to be patient and smart with how and when to move. 

I will list some guys to watch on YouTube:

Firstly for overall faster paced general gameplay take a look at JROBtheFinessor and for very fast paced insane elite sweatiness take a look at Maxiq.

Secondly and these are my two favourites to actually learn from. I have tried to combine how they both play and apply it to how I play. Take a look at WilkoDiablo and WildChild99. Wilko is very unique with how he plays and Wildchild is patient and tactical. Both these two also have settings guides that are two different ends of the scale so you could try both and see if either suit you. Wilko plays really low sensitivity and fov while Wildchild uses much higher sensitivity and medium range fov. Wilko also has weapons spec guides too. 

Thirdly I recommend taking a look at Kritical Kris. He has really in depth weapons stat review guides for pretty much every gun. 

And lastly I would also recommend GetGoodGuy, Jack Frags, TheBrokenMachine, SMK Gaming, TBAG Gaming, Catalyst HD, KingAJ_15, LevelCapGaming and GreenSightGamer.",2024-02-09 23:11:08,1,,2024-02-11 18:31:31.075988

It was always quite odd to me how the message of ""untold stories of WW2"" was the point of BFV yet they still featured only Germany and Britain. But it makes sense if France and Italy would also be involved. 

It's a shame really, because there is loads of stuff they could have added:

France vs Germany

Norway/Denmark vs Germany 

Finland vs USSR (We have two Finnish weapons in game)

Japan vs China

Japan vs Britain 

Thailand vs France

Operation Barbarossa featuring Germany, Italy, Bulgaria and Romania.

There are literally thousands of mods, and the most known and popular are usually the most complex as well, like Ace (don't play the campaign with ACE, it generates conflicts in some missions)

Now some of the ones I use in no order whatsoever, mind you I play mostly SP, very rarely MP.

Animation patch. 
This improves the clonky movement that feels very outdated. Personally I think is a huge improvement. 

RHS series. Gear and vehicles. 
Awesome assets, very well designed and very detailed, goes well with missions like antistasi or KP liberation.

CUP also recommended.
There are a few if this that include maps, gear, and vehicles.

JSRS SOUNDMOD. Improved sound effects.

Real Engine. Adds a quite a few staff to the gameplay

For AI I use VCom for behavior (carefully whit this and missions like antistasi because it may conflict with the AI from the mission.)

All in one command menu. This changes the vanilla AI commands for something a little more useful. I used to use C2 but it was abandoned sadly.

Better inventory. Brings the inventory system to more modern standards.

BLASTCORE for better special effects like explosions

RAVAGE. if you are interest in creating a Dayz like experience. 

Zeus enhanced. Improves the mission editor, if you are anything like me you will spend hours here testing stuff. 

For graphic improvements I don't have any recommendations, mostly because the game tends to struggle as it is sometimes if the missions are too intense, so I leave it as it is. And personally I'm fine with that. 

It's an old game but I feel like it holds his ground still.

Welcome to this community and welcome to Arma i hope you enjoy this awesome game as I do.

EDIT: i forgot to mention ALIVE, it's like a campaign generator, awesome for SP.

Also Platoon Commander 2.

CH View Distance gives you keybinds to increase and decrease view distance and terrain quality (grass rendering, visual LOD of terrain mesh) on command, to better adjust the current scene to your frames.

Blastcore Murr Edition does a good job making explosions pretty.

Enhanced Movement allows you to climb on and down from tall objects and vault faster/jump gaps. Honestly its  ot even really necessary in the campaigns but its nice to have.

I've been apart of a handful of these checkpoint-style operations, and they usually end up in one of two ways;

1. Tower defense where you're basically defending the checkpoint against growing waves of, typically, unnamed, endless enemies. The first couple of waves are pretty fun, but after the third or fourth wave, it just becomes monotonous and boring.

2. A lot of waiting around as the Zeus struggles to get AI to go through the checkpoint correctly without either bugging out completely before they get there or just driving through the checkpoint like they don't care. Usually ends up leading to the Zeus having to manually control 90% of the AI, making it harder to have multiple AI go through.

The best checkpoint ops will always be PvP, but it can be hard to have a big enough group of defenders and attackers to make these ops really fun. The advantage is players are far less predictable compared to AI and can think of something up on the spot.

If you cannot walk freely through it you can still try to save them, but if you just move through with no restrictions then it's dead dead.
I have like 1700hrs on antistasi with ace medical alone so i can confirm that it works.

First thing that you want to do is stop any excessive bleeding (big holes or many small - two or three lesser wounds aren't gonna bleed unit that fast)
Preferably you should bandage the wounds but if theyre too many apply tourniquet on every limb with more than one wound and after that patch head and body starting from the most damaged one.
Next you should replenish blood they've lost using the biggest suitable bloodbag (but if they've lost just some blood you can do it later with smaller bag 250 - 500 ml)
After that you should chceck pulse on the limb that is bandaged and DOES NOT have applied tourniquet. If you don't feel pulse then you go cpr (make sure that you've replenished most of the lost blood at this point). You can also use Epipen shot on them to add more chance to restore the pulse during cpr and also  awake them a bit faster.
After you've confirmed that they have pulse you can bandage rest of the wounded limbs.
After everything is done you can also use morphine shot (sometimes ai/player cannot awake becouse of pain coefficient - this often is the case if hit by underbarell GL) but if they have low pulse then better wait it of since you can stop their heartbeat).
Also you should' use morphine and adrenaline epipens more than once per 5 min since it can also make their heart stop beating (those who know term morphine bombing know what i'm talking about ;). )
Also remember to remove tourniquets from patched You can also apply splint on broken limb/s. 

To put it simply:
1. Stop bleeding using bandages (and tourniquets if needed) prioretizing body and head since you can apply tourniqs on limbs.
2. Start replenishing blood loss.
3. Chceck pulse ( do cpr if needed)
4. Adrenaline epipen shot
5. Bandage rest of the wounds.

6. Splint (if needed)
7. Morphine (if needed).
8. Use personal medkit (if you have too much free time and the has patient regained consciousness) 

If I've forgot something or overlooked something feel free to correct me.

This applies to BASIC MEDICAL since I don't play on advanced version cause its already hard to put everything needed in inventory and still have room for the rest of the stuff.

Try to select a unit or all units and go through all the command menus (i.e. press F2, then press, 1, 2, 3, etc.) 

There is also a mod **C2 - Command and Control** that has a dedicated key for suppressive fire and you can even mark a zone that should be suppressed. With that it is certainly the most elaborate mod for suppressive fire. 

A basic suppressing fire command should also be included in the **All-in-One-Command** mod. 

Both of the mods are a bit buggy (C2 much more so than AiO Command). Personally, I use **Drongos Command Enhancement** which has a suppressive fire button also but I've never done much with it yet. 

I also use **LAMBS.danger**. I think most people don't know this but this AI mod does not only enhance combat AI but also gives you 3 new commands which you can bind in the options menu: assault! hide! suppress!

The whole point of scripting in BI games is to take the modding out of the exclusive realm of programmers and put it into the hands of 'ordinary' players.

Having said that, it certainly doesn't hurt to have a programming background although it would likely be better to learn Enfusion scripting as an initial stepping stone to a more formal programming education as the cost of entry is the price of a Reforger license (currently US$30). You would also need a free license of Blender (it's open source) to create 3D models of assets, if your modding interest goes in that direction.

The top skill you need to have is motivation - the willingness to do whatever it takes to produce a publicly viable/playable mod. If you are willing to do the research & make the effort to learn what needs to be learned, you will eventually be able to make whatever sort of mod you like.

Note that ""modding a game"" covers a huge range of skills & effort. Content like the Old Man campaign for Apex may be one of the most complex missions/campaigns made for the entire Arma franchise & took the max efforts of the top scripting person in all of ArmaLand & deep knowledge of Eden Editor/SQF scripting to make it happen. On the other hand, anyone can click around Eden Editor for a few minutes to bang out a perfectly serviceable if rather basic mission that is enjoyable to play.

BI deliberately released Reforger & the Reforger Tools package so that the community could get a head start on learning to mod for Arma 4. Because Enfusion/Reforger were started from scratch, both the game engine & its tool suite are pretty basic & no frills. This does not mean they lack power, on the contrary, the features that currently exist are quite powerful, if a little lean on breadth. As BI continues work on Enfusion/Reforger they will add more features to the platform, creating more ways for creators to add complexity & flavor to their content.

The best way to get to modding for Arma 4 is to get busy modding Reforger. The Reforger Tools suite is relatively basic but you have the full power of the Enfusion engine at your fingertips. The BI teams using Enfusion to develop Reforger & Arma 4 use the same version of the Tools available publicly to the community. This means you can do nearly everything they can do in your own content & that they are highly motivated to improve the suite so they can create their content more efficiently.

As is so often the case, available documentation (official, written & video) for Enfusion is not as extensive as it could be but people are adding to it as they get the opportunity. If you want to keep up on the latest news & features, you should join the appropriate channel(s) on the [Arma Platform Discord](https://discord.gg/arma), [the official Reforger forums](https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/forum/411-arma-reforger-editing/) & follow the various people you find helpful on their preferred public platforms.

There's not a great deal of hand holding but if you forth some effort, you will find the BI devs & the community can be valuable resources.

Good luck.",2024-02-06 17:14:40,5,,2024-02-11 18:33:24.820086

Best guesses, Miller and his team set them up to attack to try and buy time to get access to the East Wind device, or otherwise further that goal.

Maybe it was a show of force; attack the last remnants of NATO under the pretext of the slightest provocation, proclaim victory, and recieve further CSAT support. The AAF is nothing if not a militaristic dictatorship. This may also be explained by Miller and his team provoking them, giving them an excuse to attack.

Maybe it was part of CSAT's Apex Protocol, to further destabilize the region, but thats less likely IMO - they were already solidifying control over the region.

Who killed MacKinnon? Thats the key to the mystery. If the AAF planted the charge, then it was always going to go down. If the brits put it down, then its just the end of a series of misunderstandings.

In my headcanon, CSAT had nothing to do with it, and spends the conflict freaking out about NATO returning. When they discover Kerry's identity theres a 'holy shit someone from TF AEGIS is alive, if we kill him and it gets out we're fucked' moment and they quietly cut all attempts to kill the FIA, leaving the AAF to face them alone, and put up only token resistance to NATO's return to buy time to extract EW(td) materials without drawing attention.",2024-02-05 20:36:04,30,,2024-02-11 18:33:41.101332

 It's implied that, either, Miller actually had obtained the East Wind Device and it was on the island for extraction, so AAF attacked to get the device back.   
 Or, by other means, Miller has made AAF attack the island because he would need NATO presence on the area to be able to get the device (without NATO presence on the region, his black operations would be compromised).",2024-02-05 20:39:33,15,,2024-02-11 18:33:41.101332

My friend and I play a lot of COD on controller and use meta load outs, watch the ""tips and tricks"" videos, practice against bots without AA on, etc. Both still 1.3 KD and maybe 1.7 on a good session. We were 0.6 playing in ranked for our session yesterday. Been playing COD for years and years. AA isn't as broken as you think, despite the buzz around it. I find myself in MAYBE 1 ""close range"" fight every other game in FK ranked where AA could be useful. It's usually people poking up on a head glitch or peeking a window or ledge above me and 5+ meters away. Fighting early game with a pistol is the closest I come to these weird close range fights on a regular basis. Heck, watch Aydan play ranked. He doesn't have a ton of fights where you could ""blame"" AA for him winning the fight.

Heck, Metaphor complains periodically about AA in this game, but since the new WZ came out he went from a little over 5 to almost 7 KD. Let that sink in. 

To be honest, idc if they nerf RAA because I don't think it's as strong in practice as people think, but MnK pretending they don't have every advantage outside of very close range fights is absurd. Looting, movement, mid and long range, buy station item selection, etc. 

Was playing with a teammate last night complaining about AA, but he was playing just as well as me on controller. He would have a good game, then a bad one, then a good one, same as me.

dennis jr. is an easy pick. TRO is perhaps the best *thing* in the entire game (aside from BASE builds of course). key to just about every single offensive damage build in the game, unless you wanna get weird with it. but you will need a second battle beat hero to activate the perk. i'd recommend researching battle beat wildcat using epic flux from the research book.",2024-02-11 11:17:31,19,,2024-02-11 18:36:12.104755

Dire isn't going to contribute much to anything. Use a voucher on heroes that actually support the kinds of weapons you enjoy. Some examples of this may be buckshot raptor (from hitting a specific collection book level or birthday llamas) and he increases crit damage by 225% for shotguns, tactical assault sledgehammer (increase assault and smg critical damage by 225%), or beetlejess that increases pistol and smg critical by 225%.  


Something that I can stress enough is to not worry about mythic heroes. Use your voucher on whatever hero supports your playstyle. I made the same mistake as you before by thinking mythics must be the best but in actuality, heroes that increase regular or crit damage tend to be way more useful. If you want to run quickly for whatever reason rather than focus on bonuses that'll help you in combat, then maybe you should get Dire.

what's your latency?

Any even minimal packetloss or simply having a high latency will cause an ever increase rate at which shots fired will be completely ignored. The projectile can/will pass straight through enemies point blank or even at a distance.

Even reload/fire rates are erratic the higher the latency is, to the point that specially with a bow being the most noticeable, you can't even get an arrow to nock... you'll sit there indefinitely with a bow that has no arrow even though you have plenty of ammo.

It's kind of funny how so many people don't realize this occurs, probably because many either just take it for granted or those of us with high latency have always been aware of it.

Ever since the fortnite PVE mode was switched to PVP mode for husks, the server dictates player client, and not the other way around per how PVE mode typically works netcode wise.

Prior to this change which has been a few years now, movement and weapon swap and everything client side was just assumed for the most part correct. The result of which was a flawless experience playing the game, specially as an outlander, i've lost count how i've had to stand and wait for objects around me to break and for the game to register that i've moved... for up to 5 seconds at least... i don't have 5000ms latency, but the server seems to spend a copious amount of time just assuming you didn't do what you did... taking ages to calculate it.. 

Prior to this change, you'd be able to just keep smashing through shit left and right without getting constantly hung up and rubber banded.",2024-02-11 07:25:58,1,,2024-02-11 18:36:25.088497

Depending on level, experience and if you can get a few like-minded folks, you can get them all done in 5ish minutes (some faster), while also getting all urns. If you alternate say Inferno and Grotto, you can get the minibosses done every other run too. The melee or time trials ones give slightly more tickets, just like the higher the level does too.

And since you didn't mention the store. Get heroes, defenders and survivors from there too and if you have gold to spare, get every kind of flux to upgrade heroes for more manuals.

Levelling your collection book can drop manuals too.

If anyone drops you high level stuff (usually power level 130/144 (it'll say on the gun)), don't use it. It's incredibly overpowered for your current zone and you don't need it. It's better to have fun than to beat everything instantly. If someone drops you it, move it into your storage. 

Listen to the main story. You only get it once, and it's pretty good. 

Use your research points (the green ones)

Upgrade your survivors in the survivor squads.  Make sure they match at least the first icon (2nd also recommended, but the first is great on its own). If you have 0 matching ones, just slot someone there anyways.
